Black Cat CMS is based on LEPTON v2.0 Alpha, as released in May 2012. (See http://www.lepton-cms.org) 
After the key developers left the LEPTON Project in May 2012, there seemed to be no more development 
concerning that version, so we decided to take and finish our work. So, Black Cat CMS is what is called a "fork".

As the development of Black Cat CMS is still in progress, there's no version for production use at the 
moment, but you can always download the current development state here. Just remember that this 
is not "stable", so there may be (lots of) bugs, or the complete thing may don't work at all.

At the moment, we plan to release a first Beta around the middle of the year 2013.
