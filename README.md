**PLEASE NOTE: Massive code rework in progress, current builds will not work!**

Black Cat CMS is based on LEPTON v2.0 Alpha, as released in May 2012. (See http://www.lepton-cms.org) 
After the key developers left the LEPTON Project in May 2012, there seemed to be no more development 
concerning that version, so we decided to take and finish our work. So, Black Cat CMS is what is called a "fork".

The name "BlackCat" is derived from the forum names of the founders: creative<strong>cat</strong> and <strong>Black</strong>Bird.

As the development of Black Cat CMS is still in progress, there's no version for production use at the 
moment, but you can always download the current development state here. Just remember that this 
is not "stable", so there may be (lots of) bugs, or the complete thing may don't work at all.

**Please note that, at the moment, nightly builds most likely will not work, as extensive
code rework is in progress.**

At the moment, we plan to release a first Beta around the middle of the year 2013.
